# AIcompiler
A coding compiler that allows people to make typos while coding. Upon running the script the AI makes a guess of what the user was trying to do. It then fakes the output allowing the user to write code in english and still get the output they wanted. It only works for terminal apps, but I would like to make it work for more later on.
