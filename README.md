# AIcompiler
A coding compiler that allows people to write pseudocode and then have it be converted into normal C code. You *will* need to have GCC set up and will need to compile your code, it does write your code for you though. Here's how to use it!

## Here are the following steps needed!

1. This will not be explained in this tutorial but please download both Python and GCC
2. Clone the repo using by going into the terminal and running `git clone https://github.com/LordWeegie/AIcompiler.git` (this requires git to be installed)
3. Please enter the repo you just cloned and open the python file in any text editor.
4. You are going to need to change the API key, please put your deepseek API key inside the highlited box in figure 1.1, if it's not a deepseek API you will need to change the URL but I will only be explaining this for deepseek.
5. Please create the files shown in figure 1.2 they may be called anything you wish but must contain the file extensions shown in figure 1.2.
6. You will now need to run the file. If you are on windows please run `python main.py` if you are on any UNIX based operating system please run `python3 main.py`.
7. Finally please type the names of both your text file and your C file. Like in figure 1.3.
That's it! Your done! Thanks!
